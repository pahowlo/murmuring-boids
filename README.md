Contains source code for a semi-3D boids simulation.

## Requirements

- python (see `.python-version`) to run scripts.
- node (see `.nvmrc`) to support vite mostly.
- pnpm to install npm dependencies. Only if you want to be able to use reliably the pnpm scripts.

These are not strict requirements and you might get away using older versions, but I don't want to test all possible combinations.

## Quick start

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm demo
```
